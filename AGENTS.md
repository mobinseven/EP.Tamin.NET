# Architecture Rules

Always strictly* follow these architecture rules:

- One responsibility per unit.
- One active context/state model.
- Minimize knowledge between components.
- Use abstractions to hide implementation details.
- Separate state-changing actions from read-only queries.
- Validate inputs and handle failures safely.
- Make features extensible without rewriting stable code.
- Protect core logic from unnecessary change.
- The most CRITICAL rule: Keep the design simple. Keep it simple stupid.  
- Use one source of truth for shared data and rules.

\* Strcitly following a rule means not following it must be considered a red line and a deal breaker.
